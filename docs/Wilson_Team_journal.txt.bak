Wil - 
after han setup the base application I went to make the pages
after about an hour han tells me he already made the pages (he just must not have pushed it bc I didn't see it).

Worked with Han on Figma
	made wireframes for pages we want to display

Worked on and handed in Project Proposal
	With team input of course to make sure we all aligned with the project going forward

Decide who works on what 
	Josh - styling for application
	Han - "jobs and person" search pages
	Abdul - "title" search page (movies)
	Wil - Github admin/Genre page

haven't worked on the project in a few days, using assignment 3 to get me started on LINQ and XAML

Making Genre Page
	Making LINQ statement
	Binding data on XAML

Helping Abdul restore db
	This proved to not be possible given the stateagy we tried (using a query to restore and get .mdf/.ldf).
	this did not hinder us however as when he would upload his code to github Han or I was able 

GitHub issues
	A lot of IDE files (caches/.dll/.suo/etc...) change CONSTANTLY and are CONSTANTLY making conflicts for merges/pushs/pulls
	CONSTANTLY having to delete my local repo and get the repo from online.
	figuring out how to make .gitignore 
		Even after we have .gitignore all the files we tell it to ignore are still there (????)
